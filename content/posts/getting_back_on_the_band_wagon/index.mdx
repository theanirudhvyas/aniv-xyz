import { Link } from "theme-ui"

On the 2nd day of August, I wrote a <Link to="/blog/goals-and-systems/">post</Link>, no, I made a promise, about setting goals and working on them. I meant for it be a beginning of a series of accountability updates to overcome my habit of procrastination and not putting much conscious thought on work and priorities.

So, I set myself 9 Goals üò± that I wished to achieve in 2 weeks (what what I thinking?).

Well to say the least, I failed spectacularly, it has been 3 months and I haven‚Äôt posted an update yet. 
Now, I don‚Äôt want to make excuses, but let me make an atempt (just for the sake of getting it out of my system).

In the past 3 months:
- I have travelled for multiple weeks to 3 different cities.
- Started a new team at work and with a complete different tech stack and team.
- Spent almost a month learning competitive programming where I solved over [100 problems](https://github.com/theanirudhvyas/dsa) in 20-25 days
- Moved out from my place in Bangalore üò¢, put most of my stuff in storage and moved back home due to the pandemic

Nonetheless, all these are excuses and do not justify the fact that I broke my promise. Its time to get back up and try this again. I won‚Äôt give up easy. 
Though I need to put in some penalties so that this does not happen again. (More on this later)

So, a retrospective of my <Link to="/blog/goals-and-systems/">previous goals</Link>

1. **Side Project:**
    1. Ad-blocker over VPN ‚úÖ 
    2. 3D Donut ‚úÖ
        1. Build the¬†[3d Donut](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html).
        2. I [built](https://github.com/theanirudhvyas/3d_donut) this is in ruby. Did not build it in clojure as there would not be a lot of difference and I lost interest.
2. **Introspection:**
    1. Publish a list of my long term goals ‚ùå
        1. I have a list of areas in which I want to focus on: health, writing, knowledge and side projects. 
    2. Decide on stakes and rewards for these goals and publish them for the next set of goals ‚úÖ
        1. **If I don‚Äôt have an update post by 2nd December 2020, I‚Äôll give 5000 INR to a charity.**
        2. **If I fail to complete any of the goal, that will be 1000 bucks to a charity for every goal**
3. **Health:**
    1. Workout on 5/7 days for the next 2 weeks.
        1. Other than the weeks where I was out of town (travelling) or was in quarantine, I was pretty consistent with my workouts, but that is not to say much,  as I was either in quarantine or not at home for well over a month (agregate)
    2. Build a workout plan that I can follow to help me with my cutting. ‚ùå
        1. I found a plan called the happy body, the idea and initial understanding seems very promising. You can listen to the podcast on this by Tim ferriss. I‚Äôm reading the book and ramping up with the programme now.
    3. I've started a cutting diet, to not go over my allowed calories for more than 1 day in a week ‚ùå
        1. The diet went up for a toss, I don‚Äôt think tracking every calorie eaten is sustainable for me, I don‚Äôt eat a lot of packaged food, so it is very hard to track calories in everything I eat. Instead I‚Äôll try to implement a holistic diet. The happy body programme has a diet component and I‚Äôll update it here when I finish the book
4. **Writing:** ‚úÖ
    1. Published my <Link to='/blog/effective-eng'>notes</Link> for the book, The effective Engineer
5. **Reading** ‚ùå
    1. Complete the book¬†[Kafka Streams in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/kafka-streams-in-action)


## Next Months Goals. ##

1. **Health**

    1. **Workout** - I‚Äôm working on consistency now so I want to log an exercise 5 days a week

    2. **Meditation** - Again, working on consistency here, my goal is to meditate everyday for 10 minutes

    3. **Penalty:** If I fail in doing this, I'll pay INR 1000 to a charity

2. **Projects**

    1. I'll open source the opentelemetry automations(helm charts and terraform module) I've been working on. To be precise.


3. **Writing**

    1. I'll publish a blog post a week for the next month. So that is 4 posts before the next post

4. **Knowledge**
    1. Book: Mastering Distributed Tracing
    2. Book: The Happy Body
