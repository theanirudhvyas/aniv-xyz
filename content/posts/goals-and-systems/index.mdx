> What gets measured gets managed - Peter Drucker


Ever since College, I've had this constant failure of not being able to complete personal projects or follow up on personal commitments (writing regular blogs for e.g.). 
For the longest time I thought that it was due to my lack of a clear and defined goal, which was validated frequently by books like Getting Things done and blogs. Being frustrated at this inability to go through with projects and with a bruised confidence I carried on with College, as I had not trouble completing projects with a tight deadline and a couple of sleepless nights. 

I graduated in June 2017 and promptly started working at Gojek in July. The work initially was challenging, but I thrived and quickly learned a lot. By October 2017 shipping multiple features accross the stack and building a framework that is now used by the entire company. At the time, I had completely forgotten about my crippling inability to complete projects, and though it did not show its ugly head then, it was soon to return and demolish all the self confidence I had worked hard on building in the last year and a half.
Now, in hindsight, I'll attribute this to the planning and processes defined by my more experienced team-mates.

It all started going downhill on 29th July 2019. On my first morning back from a vacation, I was informed that my Tech Lead had rolled off the team and I'll have to take up the reigns and start where he left off. To be honest, I had no clue what I was in for and it all seemed very exciting and fun at the time.
Before I get ahead of myself, here's a litttle context: my team (lambda) builds and manages a PAAS for the developers in the company, we have automated code generation, deployments, monitoring, all the related Infrastructure (Invisible Infrastructure) and the framework that people use to write their applications. With just 3 people in the team, all Product management, customer relations, Architecture decisions, hiring and actual developement is done by the lead (which as it turns out I had naively become). For the first time since college, I was on my own, and with with my [monkey mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU&list=PLiAqvMJOAIKtu5ZENVgZ_ewYJX3crpTVU) in control, things weren't about to go well. 

To say that I struggled for the first couple of months would be an understatement. The team was a mess, we would frequently skip standups and would rarely have planning meeetings. The few features that we shipped in those months were from our backlog, which very few customers adopted. For as long as I remember, I've had this self sabotaging habit of not asking for help and trudging through the misery until something works, but this particular time I could see no light at the end of the tunnel. Finally, I went to [Shobhit](http://www.sinisterlight.com) for some guidance and that was the inflection point when things took an upturn. Though it was not an immediate change, with some guidance and elbow grease I was able to bring the team around (story for another time). Over the next serveral months, empowered with this system, we onboarded 2 more members to the team, shipped various major features, and scaled up the services from 70 to 250.
 
The things that helped me turn things around for the team were:
1. **long term goals**: i created a longterm roadmap for the product and shared it with the stakeholders
2. **Short term Goals**: I started maintaining a priorities doc for 2 weeks ahead that helped us avoid distractions.
3. **Discipline**: I improved on my own discipline in setting up standups and planning meetings which directly translated to the team's discipline
4. **Accountability**: Every two weeks we started having a meeting with the stakeholders around the work done in the last iteration and work planned in the next iteration


All along this journey I was completely focused on work and my personal projects and work went on the backburner. 
But now I finally have the time and energy to focus on my own side projects and hobbies and with the uncertainties that COVID has put us in, it has never been more important to build a personal brand and learn new things.
I've been stuck at home for the past 5 months and the constant work, disturbances on slack and isolation have more or less burned me up. I hope these turn out to be a refuge from the constant barrage of work and help me build some systems and self discipline.

Okay, so how do I start? 
By defining some short term goals and being disciplined on them. Over time I'll publish my long term goals and add some accountability to them as well! In the meantime, I urge you (yes you) to hold me accountable to these! Ping me if I haven't updated these by 17th August, and I'll donate money to a charity or block my netflix (or something similar).

## My goals for the Next 2 Weeks ##

1. **Side Project:**
   1. I'm working on a project to provide an ad blocker as a service. Completion criteria: setup a VPN that when connected to blocks all adds on the device. Make the system work with android, ios and mac clients.
   2. Build the [3d Donut] in ruby and Clojure as I'm interested in the concepts and also how diffirent will it be to implement in functional as compared to OOP
2. **Introspection:**
   1. Publish a list of my long term goals
   2. Decide on stakes and rewards for these goals and publish them for the next set of goals
3. **Health:**
   1. Workout on 5/7 days for the next 2 weeks. 
   2. Build a workout plan that I can follow to help me with my cutting. 
   3. I've started a cutting diet, to not go over my allowed calories for more than 1 day in a week
4. **Writing:**
   1. Publish my notes for the book [The Effective Engineer](https://www.amazon.in/Effective-Engineer-Engineering-Disproportionate-Meaningful/dp/0996128107/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=the+effective+engineer&qid=1596389960&sr=8-2)
