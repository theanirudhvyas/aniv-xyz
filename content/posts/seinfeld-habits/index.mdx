I've been listening to [The Tim Ferris Show](tim.blog/podcast) for over 4 years now (wow!), and [this](https://tim.blog/2020/12/09/jerry-seinfeld-transcript/) podcast is definitely in the top 5 most insightful ones I've listened to.
Jerry Seinfeld, considered one of the most successful comedians alive, talks about the systems and habits he has developed that have lead to his success. His ideas around building systems to tackle hard things (like writing) can be easily translated to any other craft (coding for me for e.g.).
This particular conversation starts at time **32:26** of the podcast.

**Here is a transcript edited for brevity.**

**Jerry Seinfeld:** Well, my guiding rule is systemize. What’s the problem? The problem is — like my daughter. My daughter is very creative. So she’s trying to write this thing. She’s struggling, “I can’t write. I keep putting it off.” So I explain to her my basic system, if you’re going to write, make yourself a writing session. What’s the writing session? I’m going to work on this problem. Well, **how long are you going to work on it? Don’t just sit down with an open-ended**, “I’m going to work on this problem.” That’s a ridiculous torture to put on a human being’s head.
It’s like you’re going to hire a trainer to get in shape, and he comes over, and you go, “How long is the session?” And he goes, “It’s open-ended.” Forget it. I’m not doing it. It’s over right there. You’ve got to control what your brain can take. “When is the workout over?” “It’s going to be an hour.” “Okay.” Or “You can’t take that? Let’s do 30 minutes.” “Okay, great.” Now we’re getting somewhere. “I can do 30."

...

**Jerry Seinfeld:** Okay, so — “I can’t do it 15 minutes.” “Okay, let’s do 10. Let’s do 10. Let’s come up with something you can do. That’s where you start everything. That’s how you start to build a system.” So my daughter — so I said to her, “You have to have an end-time to your writing session. If you’re going to sit down at a desk with a problem and do nothing else, you’ve got to get a reward for that. And the reward is, the alarm goes off, and you’re done. You get up and walk away and go have some cookies and milk. You’re done.”
If you have the guts and the balls to sit down and write, you need a reward at the other end of that session, which is “Stop now. Pencils down.” So that’s the beginning of a system that to me will help almost anybody learn to write, which is something I’ve kind of wanted to teach in a way, because I think it’s so simple.

**Tim Ferriss** — so important. The incentives. Right? Having a reward. Having a defined format. How long did your daughter end up choosing for her writing duration, or how long — 

**Jerry Seinfeld:** I told her — 

**Tim Ferriss:** — have you chosen?

**Jerry Seinfeld:** I told her, “Just do an hour.” That’s a lot. She says, “I’m going to write all day.” “No, you’re not. Nobody writes all day. Shakespeare can’t write all day. It’s torture.”

**Tim Ferriss:** Yeah. If you taught a class on writing, what other lessons might you have, or resources, or anything, exercises? Because I’m imagining that your daughter could sit down, she says, “All right, I have an hour.” And then you ask her how her writing session went, and she said, “Well, I didn’t have any idea what to write.” So you’d have — I don’t know what age the students would be in your course, but what else would be a component of your class on writing?

**Jerry Seinfeld:** Well, I would teach them to learn to accept your mediocrity. No one’s really that great. You know who’s great? The people that just put tremendous amount of hours into it. It’s a game of tonnage. You know?

**Tim Ferriss:** Totally.

**Jerry Seinfeld:** It’s like you’ve got to treat your brain like a dog you just got. The mind is infinite in wisdom. The brain is a stupid, little dog that is easily trained. Do not confuse the mind with the brain. The brain is so easy to master. You just have to confine it. You confine it. And it’s done through repetition and systematization.
