Hi!

I'm Anirudh, I am a software Developer and a part time product manager at Gojek. I've written the popular framework [Ziggurat](https://github.com/gojek/ziggurat) and have scaled it up to more than 200 applications in the company.
I've given a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRKclPWxL9I&list=PLlAML-kjpXY7kzJp0p1EPJ9eb8B15CCBU&index=12&t=0s) on how we evolved Ziggurat at [In/Clojure](https://inclojure.org/).

This website is a home for me on the interwebs and will be a place for my thoughts, projects and ideas.

I started coding in College and fell in love with python and robotics. Dabbled in some NLP and published a [research paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-69900-4_61) on generating summaries from football commentary transcripts.

For the past 3 years I've been dabbling in Ruby, Clojure and have been spending a lot of time building a PAAS solution for event sourcing and stream processing.
